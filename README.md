# tabusearch-on-OPHS
Tabu search algorithm on team orienting problem with hotel selection.
<br/>
The starting hotel is 0 and the ending hotel is 1.
--contact me for more info on benchmarks and what they contain. <br/>
The benchmarks are located at github.com/ciph3rx/tabusearch-on-OPHS/AA-benchmark.rar .<br/>
The local search implemented here is just a small local search. it can be improved a lot.<br/>
After initialization of the file, there is a random hotel selection function for the trips so that we would get to the last hotel in time.
